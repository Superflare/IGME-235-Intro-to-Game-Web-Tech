            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>While fixated on grabbing coins floating in the middle of the screen, the player must also jump back and
                forth from the left and right wall to avoid enemies and moving obstacles along the walls</p>

            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>Wall Jump Frenzy is an action and avoidance game that lets the player jump right in to fast paced, addicting, and
                challenging gameplay</p>

            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>Desktop and mobile friendly</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The game's story is mostly abstract but there is a general motivation for the in-game player to want to
                not get hit by deadly obstacles and the motivation for collecting coins and powerups would come from the
                actual human player. The general mood or feel of the game will be lighthearted and fun with slight
                tension sprinkled in when obstacles are spawned in</p>

            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p><b>Graphics Style:</b> Colorful and cartoonish<br>
                <b>Sound:</b> 8-bit, ambient, techno<br>
                <b>Sounds in-game:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Background music</li>
                <li>Obstacle/enemy collision</li>
                <li>Coin pickup</li>
                <li>Game over</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Jump while riding along a side wall towards the other wall and have the ability to jump anytime in
                    midair, with a limit on how fast jumps can be activated. When the player does nothing they will
                    slide down the wall and wrap around the screen vertically, this can be used to avoid obstacles as
                    they won't wrap. Once the player makes it far enough they can run into powerups as well as coins
                    that will help them stay alive longer</p>
                <h3>Controls</h3>
                <p>Mouse click and/or touchscreen tap</p>
                <h3>Teaching the game</h3>
                <p>There will be an onscreen prompt for the player to click or tap on the start screen. Clicking on the
                    start screen will begin the game and cause the character to jump to a wall, so the player should
                    link that action to another click or tap and understand the basics of the game from there. There
                    will be a short instructions section on the site just in case</p>
                <h3>Player Learning</h3>
                <p>The player will not be told, however, that they can jump multiple times and will be left to stumble
                    upon that themselves. The player must also learn certain traits or patterns of how the obstacles
                    move or appear through playing to develop a more efficient playstyle and in return reach higher
                    scores</p>
            </div>
