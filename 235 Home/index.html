            Hello! My name is Nathan Wildofsky and I'm a second year GDD student here at RIT. I'm very interested in
            video games and the stories told within them, but I also enjoy star wars, anime, card games, tennis, disc
            golf, and cooking. I am enjoying the added freedom of my second year here due to living in an apartment and
            having my car here, even though COVID takes a lot of that away. Games are my favorite medium for
            storytelling and for just plain fun, and programming encompasses a lot of fields I do well in, so my goal is
            to become a game developer for hopefully a AAA game company whose games I love, like Blizzard or Naughty
            Dog. I hope that from this class I can get a good introductory background into web development that I could
            either pursue later or keep with me as general knowledge.
        </p>
