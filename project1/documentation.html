            <h2>Design Process and Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>Why does this site exist?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a showcase of my best work and a better first impression than my resume</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What is this site's goal?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intrigue possible recruiters with the site's first landing and keep them interested with my work
                    showcase</li>
                <li>Make me stand out from other possible hires</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Who will be using the site?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Professional recruiters quickly looking over many applicants' resumes and portfolios</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What are some characteristics of these users?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Readyd to skim over the whole site to find anything worthwhile, will only be on the site for a
                    limited time</li>
                <li>Most likely using a desktop or laptop to view with a fast connection, but a site designed for mobile
                    and smaller widths should be designed anyway</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Brainstorm Features</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carousel in first landing with brief information about each project on hover and a picture</li>
                <li>Fixed position navbar at the top of the screen
                    <ul>
                        <li>About me</li>
                        <li>Projects</li>
                        <li>Contact me</li>

                        <li>Mobile navebar will have a dropdown menu and name/logo</li>

                <li>Contact icons for social media and a form for messages</li>
                <li>Customized form in the footer to make contacting me easier and be able to be done in-site</li>
                <li>Carousel gallery will have brief information so individual project sections should be large enough
                    to allow for a decent amount of descritpion of the development process, what kind of project it was,
                    the challenges I faced, and what I learned</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sources">Navbar and Contact Info form font from Bootstrap Framework <a

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="notes">I was not too picky with my placeholder images sizes (they are all the same size) but I did use a
                    image
                    size close to the likely image dimensions my screenshots of my actual projects will be. If my actual
                    image sizes turn out to be very different and mess up the layout of the page, I think my current
                    size is
                    close enough to the aspect ration that an image could span over the section it is in and have some
                    parts
                    of its edges cut off</li>
                <li class="notes">I did not try out having images of different sizes in my carousel but I believe my screenshots I use
                    will be of consistent size so there won't be too much of an issue with variability between the
                    images in the carousel</li>
                <li class="notes">When adding actual projects to this portfolio I am going to add a more bulleted-style to the longer
                    description of my projects so that recruiters can see important information fast. I am also planning
                    on changing the captions in the carousel when adding projects to contain the most brief and
                    important information, and to make that bigger so it can be seen better when actual images are in
                    the carousel</li>
                <li class="notes">To make updates to the content of my portfolio after adding my original projects I will add a new
                    project flexbox and add the image to the carousel. I will either change the project order by just
                    moving the html around or change the order of the flexboxes in css</li>
