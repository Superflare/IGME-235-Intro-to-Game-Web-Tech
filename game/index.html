        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Dig Dug is a 1-2 player <strong>arcade game</strong> in which you have to use your <strong>shovel</strong> to dig your way through the earth. Stopping
            you from doing this are two monsters, called <strong>Pooka</strong> and <strong>Fygar</strong>, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon
            that you carry is an <strong>air pump</strong>, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

            This definitely goes under the heading of <em>"Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs,"</em> or at least had a
            good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br>
