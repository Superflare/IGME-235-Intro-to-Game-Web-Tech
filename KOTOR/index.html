        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20 rule system, which is similar to the
            <em>3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons</em>. Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous
            RPGs such as the <em>Baldur's Gate series</em>. Combat engine follows similar <em>"real-time with pause"</em> rules. There
            are only three active combatants on the player's side (as opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join
            the party and can be switched at the player's will.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the
            homeworld of the Wookiees, the desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various ways and
            performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the forces of <span class="light">Light</span> and
            <span class="dark">Darkness.</span> The player can turn the main character into a <span class="light">flawless Jedi</span>,
            a <span class="dark">ruthless Sith</span>, or anything in between. Some of the player's choices influence major
            events that occur within the storyline.

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
                With Knights of the Old Republic, BioWare has constructed a brilliant Star Wars taleâ€”<em>arguably the best one
            since The Empire Strikes back.</em> It captures everything that was great about those first films and wraps it
            around a deep, thoughtful role-playing experience. Do not hesitate, Padawan. This one is a classic. Buy it.
